                        Over the last few years took some interest in Programming Languages. Now i put this Language
                        together, from what
                        i learned over many failed projects.

                        This blog is written as a source of information from what i wished i knew earlier and to show
                        what i learned.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
                        The first Language i did, was a Interpreted, but staticly typed one. I rewrote the Compiler to
                        be self hostet,
                        but
                        eventually was limited by my knowledge and the old codebase without any LSP or assistance. The
                        self hostet
                        "Schematic" Code is still up.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mt-4">
                        So i decided to start new. This time the Compiler was written in Java.
                        Self hosting still has to wait till i got an LSP up and running. I made the decision to make it
                        compatible with the Java VM. That means compiling it to bytecode, witch was essentially the easy
                        part. The more difficult part was the interaction between my language and existing jvm classes.
                        I didn't implemented any Generics, as ASM didnt offer a parser for the java generic bytecode
                        format. I eventually archived my goal tho, as i got ~90% of features with the jvm. This Language
                        is probably the better to actually program in, as you got java support, operator overloading,
                        extension functions, macros and other convenient functionality.
                        Maybe i will come to this Language back again. The Source for "Stella" is also still up.
